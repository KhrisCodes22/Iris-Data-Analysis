# Iris-Data-Analysis
performing data analysis on a dataset iris.data

This code is for an assignment in a university of waterloo datascience course I am taking.
the python file reads in data form iris.data, and performs analysis on that data.
first, scatter plots are created showing petal and sepal length and width, for all different types of flowers(setosa, versicolor, virginica).
I then partitioned the data into training and test sets, and created a KNN classifier using scikit learn.
I then varied the number of nearest neighbors that were used, to get an idea of an optimal amount of neighbors, 
then displayed a graph of my findings.
